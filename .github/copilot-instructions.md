PULL REQUEST REVIEW RULES (MANDATORY)

C++ STRUCTURE RULES:

- Header (.h) files MUST declare:
  - Initialize()
  - Deinitialize()

- Source (.cpp) files MUST implement:
  - Initialize()
  - Deinitialize()

- Do NOT allow missing declarations or implementations.

WHEN REVIEWING PRS:
- Check header and source consistency.
- If missing, suggest corrected C++ code.
